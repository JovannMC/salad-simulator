# Salad Simulator
Hello! This doesn't contain any code, this repository is just used to host the builds for my game.<br/>
You should read the `readme.txt` file. <br/>

## What?
This game simulates running Salad, a program that allows you to rent out spare computing power to earn money!<br/>
Use Salad, buy hardware, pay bills, etc.<br/>
Yeah this is a trash game which barely has any gameplay currently, **please don't play it.**<br/>

## How?
Download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/JovannMC/salad-simulator/releases)
